# Equipment Tracker

# Summary

This project is a simple **Equipment Tracker** built using React. It allows users to manage equipment details by performing basic operations such as viewing a list of equipment, adding new items, editing existing records, and deleting equipment when it is no longer needed.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of **React fundamentals**, especially how to manage data on the frontend using state and how to build real-world CRUD functionality in a clean and structured way.

## What the Project Does

* Displays a list of equipment in a table format
* Allows users to add new equipment using a form
* Enables editing of existing equipment details
* Supports deleting equipment records instantly

All data handling is done on the frontend using React state, without a backend, to keep the focus on core React concepts.

## Technologies & Tools Used

### Frontend Technologies

* **React.js** – For building the user interface using components
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For application logic
* **JSX** – To structure UI inside React components
* **HTML5** – Basic markup
* **CSS** – Simple styling for layout and readability

### Tools & Platforms

* **Node.js** – Runtime environment
* **npm** – Dependency management
* **VS Code** – Code editor
* **Git** – Version control
* **GitHub** – Project hosting and sharing

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* React functional components
* useState hook for state management
* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Controlled form inputs
* Dynamic table rendering using map()
* Clean and readable component structure

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/equipment-tracker.git

2. Move into the project folder
bash
cd equipment-tracker

3. Install dependencies

http://localhost:3000


## Future Improvements

* Connect the application to a backend (Node.js + Express)
* Store data in a database (MongoDB or MySQL)
* Add search and filter functionality
* Improve UI using Bootstrap or Material UI
